# Algerian-Forest-Fire-
The Algerian forest fire dataset is a collection of 244 records from two regions in Algeria: Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes. The dataset contains information about the date, time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and area burned by the forest fires. The dataset is available on kaggle for more details.
I have worked on this dataset, starting with understanding the given data and some EDA. 
I have also included both the raw and cleaned datasets.
The EDA has been further extended in the model creation part.
I have chosen to implement linear, lasso, and ridge regressions.
There are a few visualizations that can be tweaked as per your wish.
